/// The `RTKDFUManager` class provides two scan methods for scaning for device in OTA mode and scaning for companion device.
/// Don't call ``RTKLEFoundation/RTKProfileConnectionManager/scanForPeripherals:`` which is inherited from ``RTKLEFoundation/RTKProfileConnectionManager`` on this class instance to scan for nearby devices, this class only support scan for OTA mode device and companion device.

/// - Parameter connection: The connection with device for which to scan its in OTA mode device object.
/// - Parameter deviceInfo: The object containing information of this device when scanning.
/// - Parameter handler: The completion handler to call when the expected device is found or time out occurs.

/// Although there is only one physical device, SDK uses two `RTKConnectionUponGATT` objects to represents normal mode device and OTA mode device. When a device switches to OTA mode, call this method to discover the device in OTA mode. When the device in OTA mode is discovered, the `handler` block is invoked with `otaModeDevice` parameter set to object that represents the device in OTA mode.
