/**
 * A RTKOTAProfile object used for manage peripherals that are about to be upgraded.
 *
 * @discussion A RTKOTAProfile is a concrete subclass of RTKLEProfile, with APIs to create RTKOTAPeripheral instance and return RTKDFUPeripheral instances.
 *
 * To upgrade a remote device, you typically have a known CBPeripheral object represents a remote device to upgrade, call -instantiatePeripheralWithCBPeripheral: with the known CBPeripheral to get an RTKOTAPeripheral object.
 *
 *  Normal upgrade flow:
 *  1. Having an RTKOTAPeripheral instance which did be connected by RTKOTAProfile;
 *  2. Call @code -[RTKOTAProfile translatePeripheral:toDFUPeripheralWithCompletion:] @endcode to get a @c RTKDFUPeripheral instance to upgrade;
 *  3. Call @code -[RTKOTAProfile connectTo:] @endcode with  @c RTKDFUPeripheral instance retured in Step 2;
 *  4. When @c RTKOTAProfile report connection event, now you can start upgrade images by call @c RTKDFUPeripheral methods.
 *
 *   Silent upgrade flow:
 *   1. Having an RTKOTAPeripheral instance which did be connected by RTKOTAProfile;
 *   2. Call @code -[RTKOTAProfile DFUPeripheralOfOTAPeripheral:] @endcode with @c RTKOTAPeripheral object to return a @c RTKDFUPeripheral object for upgrade;
 *   3. Call @code -[RTKOTAProfile connectTo:] @endcode with  @c RTKDFUPeripheral instance retured in Step 2;
 *   4. When @c RTKOTAProfile report connection event, now you can start upgrade images by call @c RTKDFUPeripheral methods.
