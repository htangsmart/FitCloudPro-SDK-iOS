 * @class RTKOTAPeripheral
 *
 * Represents a remote LE device, exposing OTA upgrade related information.
 *
 * @discussion An @c RTKOTAPeripheral object exposes information(i.e. BDAddress) about a LE device which is able to be DFU upgraded. You get information of installed binarys by @c bins property, which provide image type and version info.
 * To determine whether the remote device can be upgraded in normal mode, you call @c -canEnterOTAMode. And if silent upgrade can be used can be determined by @c -canUpgradeSliently.
 *
 * This class does not provide methods to start upgrade procudure, it's a responsibility of a @c DFUPeripehral object. Call @code -[RTKOTAProfile translatePeripheral:toDFUPeripheralWithCompletion:] @endcode to get a DFUPeripheral for normal upgrade, and call @code -[RTKOTAProfile DFUPeripheralOfOTAPeripheral:] @endcode to get a DFUPeripheral for silent upgrade.
 *
 * @note All methods and properties of this class are available only when @c RTKOTAPeripheral object is connected to RTKOTAProfile.

 * @see RTKDFUPeripheral
