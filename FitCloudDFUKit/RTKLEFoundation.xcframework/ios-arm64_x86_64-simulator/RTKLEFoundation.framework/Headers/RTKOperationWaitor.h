NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/// A general purpose object that you use to wait for an asynchronous task to be completed.
///
/// Once you have an ``RTKOperationWaitor`` object, call ``RTKOperationWaitor/wait`` or ``RTKOperationWaitor/waitWithTimeout:`` to begin waiting, then call ``RTKOperationWaitor/cancel`` to stop waiting. The completion handler you pass to ``RTKOperationWaitor/initWithToken:completionHandler:`` will be invoked when either the waitting task is complete or time out occurs. You call ``RTKOperationWaitor/fulfillWithUserInfo:`` to tell the waitor task completion and the waitor then calls completion handler with `success` set to `YES` and `error` set to `nil`. If time out occurs, the completion handler is invoked with `success` set to `NO` and `error` set to a valid error object. A completed (fulfulled or time out) waitor can not receive ``RTKOperationWaitor/wait`` method, nor ``RTKOperationWaitor/cancel`` and ``RTKOperationWaitor/fulfill`` methods.
///
/// When you call ``RTKOperationWaitor/fulfillWithUserInfo:`` with a non-nil pointer as `userInfo`, this pointer will be pass to `userInfo` parameter of the completion handler.
///
/// You can use `token` property to associate any value to a waitor. If you pass an object as token parameter to `-initWithToken:completionHandler: `, the token is assigned the the object pointer value without retain it.
